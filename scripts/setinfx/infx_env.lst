#Example configuration file for setinfx. Fields separated by pipe (|):
#File should be located in ~informix/etc
#Environment Desc|$INFORMIXSERVER|$ONCONFIG|$INFORMIXDIR|SERVER_INFORMIXDIR / FGLDIR |$INFORMIXSQLHOSTS|ENV_TYPE[SD]||HOSTNAME / LOCAL|SCRIPT_TO_EXECUTE
#SERVER_INFORMIXDIR is the directory where ther server is installed, for "D" Development environments
# ENV_TYPE:
#           D|d - Development Environments
#           S|s - Server Environments
#           Y - dYnamic 4GL 
#           g - Genero environments
# HOSTNAME can be replaed by "LOCAL" for a local environment
# SCRIPT_TO_EXECUTE should point to a SHELL script in ~informix/etc which will be executed after setting the environment
# NOTES!:
# 	The 8th field should be empty! Maybe the script should be changed to ignore it and shift 9th and 10th...
#	Any line starting with "inactive" will be counted but not shown. That's the correct way to remove an environment without disturbing the numbers od remaining
#       And naturally any line staring with "#" is a comment line and is ignored.
# Examples:
# App1 Env (ADM)|ol_app1|onconfig.ol_app1|/usr/informix/srvr1210fc10_ol_app1|=|/usr/informix/etc/sqlhosts|S||LOCAL|app1_adm_extra.sh
# App1 Env (DEV)|ol_app1||/usr/informix/tools732uc3|/usr/informix/srvr1210fc10_ol_app1|/usr/informix/etc/sqlhosts|D||LOCAL|app1_dev_extra.sh
# App1 Env (DEV Genero)|ol_app1||/usr/informix/tools732uc3|/usr/informix/genero|/usr/informix/etc/sqlhosts|Y||LOCAL|app1_genero_extra.sh
